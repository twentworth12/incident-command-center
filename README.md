   - Pair your Apple TV with Xcode (Window > Devices and Simulators)

4. **Build and Deploy**
   - Select your Apple TV as the target device
   - Build and run the project (‚åò+R)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build for Apple TV Simulator
xcodebuild -project incident-overview.xcodeproj -scheme incident-overview -sdk appletvsimulator -configuration Debug build

# Build for physical Apple TV device
xcodebuild -project incident-overview.xcodeproj -scheme incident-overview -sdk appletvos -configuration Release build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -project incident-overview.xcodeproj -scheme incident-overview -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV'
```
